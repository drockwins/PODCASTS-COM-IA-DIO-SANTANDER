Oh man, Jason — that first match in *RedSec*?  
It was pure chaos.  
I dropped right into the industrial zone, thinking I was safe…  
and within seconds, I hear bullets, drones, and some guy yelling “cluster strike inbound!”  
[Laughs]  
It was nuts — but in the best way possible.

[SFX: distant gunfire, light reverb for atmosphere]

The environment is insane, man.  
You’ve got sandstorms sweeping through, neon reflections from destroyed billboards, and that eerie silence right before a firefight.  
It’s immersive — like the map’s alive and watching you.

When it comes to strategy, I’m all about balance.  
I run a compact SMG and a long-range DMR — that way I can handle close quarters and still tag enemies across rooftops.  
And always, always carry smoke grenades.  
They save lives.

[SFX: light reload + smoke hiss sound]

Tension moments? Oh, I’ve had plenty.  
Once, I was the last in my squad, pinned behind a wrecked tank, low on ammo…  
I flanked right through a gas cloud — could barely see — and somehow wiped an entire trio with a shotgun.  
[Laughs proudly]  
I don’t even know how I survived.

Team comms are key.  
My crew and I joke around a lot, but we’ve got that chemistry — quick callouts, pings, trust.  
One time my buddy yelled, “He’s in the building!” and it was literally *me*.  
We still laugh about that every time.

[SFX: faint radio static and laughter]

For beginners?  
Don’t rush.  
Take it slow, learn the terrain, listen for audio cues — footsteps, drones, reloads.  
Sound tells half the story in *RedSec*.

And yeah, man — I’m hyped for whatever DICE adds next.  
New maps, new storm mechanics, maybe even vehicles dropping mid-match.  
Can’t wait.

[SFX: upbeat tone rising slightly]

This was awesome, Jason — thanks for having me on, brother.

[Laughs and fade out]
